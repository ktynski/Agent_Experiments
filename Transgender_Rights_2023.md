# Introduction

The rights of transgender individuals have become an increasingly visible and controversial topic in the United States and around the world. While transgender rights movements have made significant progress, backlash and debates continue over issues like healthcare, sports participation, bathroom access, and nondiscrimination protections. 

## Background on Transgender Rights Movement

The transgender rights movement has its roots in the mid-20th century, as transgender people began to advocate for recognition, respect, and rights.[1] Early pioneers like Christine Jorgensen, who underwent gender confirmation surgery in the 1950s, brought transgender issues into the public eye.[2] The Compton's Cafeteria Riot in 1966 and Stonewall Riots in 1969 were seminal events where transgender people stood up against police harassment, catalyzing LGBTQ activism.[3]  

Major milestones include the removal of homosexuality from the American Psychiatric Association's list of mental disorders in 1973 and the passage of nondiscrimination laws and hate crime laws protecting transgender people starting in the 1990s.[4] High-profile figures like Chaz Bono, Laverne Cox, and Caitlyn Jenner further increased transgender visibility and acceptance. Despite progress, stigma, discrimination, and violence against the transgender community remain pressing issues.

## Recent Developments

In recent years, the debate over transgender rights has intensified, with an onslaught of anti-transgender legislation proposed across the country.[5] However, support for transgender rights has also grown, with more educational resources, corporate policies, and legal protections emerging. The Biden administration has reversed several Trump-era policies, expanding protections for transgender people.[6] But political divisions and court battles continue over fundamental issues like healthcare access, sports participation, and bathroom use for transgender youth and adults.

This book will explore major developments, debates, policies, legislation, and more impacting transgender rights in 2023 in the United States and globally. It will analyze changing attitudes, legal cases, healthcare laws, hate crimes, activist movements, and factors influencing transgender rights worldwide.

# Changing Attitudes Towards Transgender Rights

Public opinion on transgender rights and issues has shifted over time, with support growing but divisions remaining. Debates over policies affecting transgender students have been particularly contentious. The Biden administration is working to expand protections, but implementation poses challenges.

## Biden Administration Rewriting Title IX Rules

The Biden administration has been working on a rewrite of rules detailing how schools should follow Title IX in regard to treatment of transgender students.[7] The proposed changes to Title IX would expand its protections to include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.[7] The release of the finalized rule changes has been delayed, with October being the new expected deadline.[7] The rule changes have not yet been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review.[7] The Office of Management and Budget has 90 days to review the rule once it is submitted.[7] A government shutdown may further lengthen the timeline for the review process.[7] 

The proposed rule changes generated a historic number of public comments.[7] The Education Department is working to review and consider all comments.[7] The Education Department continues to enforce Title IX consistent with existing law.[7]

## State Laws Targeting Transgender Students   

State laws targeting nonbinary and transgender students' ability to participate in sports, use restrooms, and go by pronouns and names consistent with their gender identity are becoming more common.[7] The Education Department released an initial proposal for a Title IX rule change in June 2022.[8] The initial proposal focused on discrimination based on sexuality and gender identity, rather than athletics.[8]

Another proposed rule was released in April 2023, which would allow schools to prevent a transgender student from playing sports if it affected competitive fairness, safety, or other objectives of the sport.[8] Neither proposed rule change has been finalized yet.[8] There are currently 23 states with laws banning transgender youth from playing sports.[8] Five of those states passed laws this year, after the Biden administration released its proposed Title IX rule on transgender athletes.[8]

## Implementation Challenges for Schools

The release of the finalized rule changes would provide more certainty for educators and students, but the transition may not be easy.[9] The proposed rule changes may require staff training, communication with parents and community members, and updates to policies and handbooks.[9] Many districts may face legal conflicts between state law and federal regulations.[9] The implementation of the rule changes may vary from state to state depending on litigation outcomes.[9] 

The Biden administration's interpretation of Title IX has been clear, and schools can include transgender youth in activities even before the rule changes are finalized.[9]

# Company Policies on Transgender Rights   

Corporate policies and practices impacting LGBTQ workers have evolved significantly in recent years following changing laws and societal attitudes. However, discrimination and barriers remain in many workplaces.

## Facts about Anti-LGBTQ+ Bills in 2023

In 2023, a total of 583 anti-trans bills were proposed across the country.[10] Out of the 583 proposed bills, 85 have already passed.[10] Among the passed bills, 84 have been signed into law.[10] One bill has passed but has not yet been vetoed or signed.[10] The number of passed bills may change as legislative sessions continue throughout the year.[10] 

In 2022, 174 anti-trans bills were proposed.[10] Out of the 174 proposed bills in 2022, 26 passed.[10] The percentage of bills passed in 2022 was 15%.[10]

## Resolving Workplace Problems

Many problems can be resolved internally, either by talking with the person who is causing a problem, or by using your company's internal complaint process.[11] Sharing copies of federal government guidance on trans workplace issues and relevant EEOC decisions may help persuade management or HR.[11] 

Find out about your company's equal employment opportunity (EEO) procedures and whether your company's EEO policy expressly covers gender identity.[11] Even if your company's EEO policy does not cover gender identity, you can still file an internal complaint.[11] Filing an internal complaint can often be resolved in days or weeks.[11]

Another possibility is having an attorney or legal organization approach your employers on your behalf to fix the problem.[11] You are not required to use your company's internal process before filing a complaint with federal, state, or local officials.[11]

## Equal Opportunity in Employment  

The Department of Labor (DOL) has been committed to promoting equal opportunity in employment since its earliest years.[12] In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[12]

On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation, reaffirming and applying the protections established in Bostock v. Clayton County.[12]

DOL's policies prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity are consistent with the policies of other federal agencies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Department of Justice (DOJ), and Office of Personnel Management (OPM).[12]

# Country-Specific Transgender Rights

Laws and social attitudes towards transgender individuals vary significantly across different countries and regions worldwide. While some countries have progressive legislation, others criminalize LGBTQ identities.

## Europe

Legal protections for trans people in Europe have shown an upward trajectory in many policy areas over the last ten years.[13] Central Asia has seen little progress in terms of legal protections for trans people.[13] The areas where most improvements have been made in terms of legal protections for trans people are the removal of restrictions on legal gender recognition and the implementation of trans-specific non-discrimination legislation.[13]

The United Kingdom and Hungary have regressed in terms of trans rights, going from progressive leaders in the Trans Rights Index in 2013 to places where anti-trans hatred is widespread in the media and government agendas.[13] Legislation alone is not enough, as implementation is crucial for effective trans rights protection.[13]

## United States

In the United States, there has been significant progress in transgender rights in recent years at the federal level, but state laws vary widely.[14] Federal laws prohibit discrimination based on gender identity in employment, healthcare, housing, and education.[15] However, over 25 states have considered bills in 2023 that would limit access to gender-affirming medical care.[16] More than 15 states have passed laws banning transgender students from playing school sports aligning with their gender identity.[17] State legislation and court battles over transgender rights are ongoing.

## Global Acceptance Index

The LGBTI Global Acceptance Index (GAI) measures the relative level of acceptance of LGBTI people and issues in each country for a specific time period.[18] Low levels of acceptance towards LGBTI people are linked to bullying, violence, physical and mental health problems, discrimination in employment, underrepresentation in civic leadership positions, lower workforce productivity, and decreased business profits.[18]

Authors updated the Global Acceptance Index using an advanced statistical model.[18] The updated Global Acceptance Index measures acceptance in 175 countries and geographic locations.[18] Acceptance is measured in terms of how LGBTI people are seen positively and inclusively, both in terms of individual opinions and positions on LGBTI policies.[18] 

Globally, the average level of acceptance has increased since 1980.[18] However, acceptance varies widely across different regions and countries. Ongoing advocacy, legal reforms, public education, corporate policies, and changing social attitudes may continue to improve the climate for LGBTQ people worldwide. But substantial challenges and threats remain.

# Court Cases Involving Transgender Rights

There have been several influential court cases in recent years involving transgender rights and issues of discrimination based on gender identity. While progress has been made, legal battles and uncertainties continue.

## Employment Discrimination Cases

In Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, the Supreme Court ruled that sex discrimination consisting of same-sex sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII.[19] This precedent paved the way for protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

The Supreme Court ruled in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins that discrimination based on sex stereotypes is prohibited under Title VII.[20] This means policies against discrimination based on gender identity or expression also protect people against sex stereotyping.

In Chavez v. Credit Nation Auto Sales, LLC, a federal court in Georgia denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the case and allowed the plaintiff's Title VII claim for discrimination based on gender identity to move forward.[21] The court recognized that the transgender employee sufficiently alleged that their termination was motivated by their failure to conform to sex stereotypes.

## Other Notable Cases

In Schroer v. Billington, the court held that discrimination against a transgender woman based on her gender identity constituted sex discrimination under Title VII.[22]

In Smith v. City of Salem, Ohio, the court held that a transgender woman who was denied employment based on her gender identity could pursue a sex discrimination claim under Title VII.[23]

In Glenn v. Brumby, the court held that discriminating against a transgender woman because of her gender identity constituted sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[24]

In Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College, the court held that discrimination based on sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination under Title VII.[25]

In R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC, the court held that discrimination against a transgender woman based on her gender identity constituted sex discrimination under Title VII.[26]

These cases demonstrate that federal courts have increasingly interpreted protections against sex discrimination in employment to include protections for LGBTQ individuals. However, uncertainty remains until more definitive nationwide protections are codified.

# Educational Policies on Transgender Rights

Policies affecting transgender students have become a major source of debate and legislation at the state level. The federal government is also proposing new rules for schools. Supporting transgender students remains a complex issue that schools are grappling with.

## Proposed Title IX Rule Changes   

Title IX was signed into law more than 50 years ago. Title IX has enabled strides in educational opportunity free from sex discrimination, including in athletics, for millions of students across the country. The U.S. Department of Education is releasing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on athletic eligibility under Title IX.

The NPRM aims to provide clarity for schools, students, parents, and coaches regarding transgender students' participation in school sports. Participation in school athletics provides physical, social, academic, and mental health benefits to students.

The proposed rule affirms that policies violate Title IX when they categorically ban transgender students from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. The proposed rule allows schools to develop eligibility criteria that protect students from being denied equal athletic opportunity while giving schools flexibility to develop their own participation policies.[27]

U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona emphasizes the importance of every student having the full experience of attending school, including participating in athletics, free from discrimination. The Department invites and encourages public comment on the proposed regulation.

## State Legislation Impacting Schools

On March 23, 2023, the Texas Legislature passed a bill regarding sexuality and gender identity in schools.[28] The bill has sparked significant controversy and debate among lawmakers, educators, and advocacy groups.[28] The legislation aims to regulate how schools address topics related to sexuality and gender identity.[28]

Supporters of the bill argue that it provides clarity and consistency in teaching these sensitive subjects.[28] Opponents of the bill claim that it restricts the rights and inclusivity of LGBTQ+ students and educators.[28] The bill requires schools to provide parental notification and opt-out options for certain curriculum materials related to sexuality and gender identity.[28] It also mandates that schools cannot teach or endorse specific viewpoints on these topics.[28]

The bill prohibits schools from providing resources or materials that promote or discuss gender transition or non-binary identities.[28] Critics argue that this restriction may harm transgender and non-binary students by limiting their access to supportive resources.[28] The legislation received support from conservative lawmakers and organizations who believe it aligns with their values and protects parental rights.[28] The bill's passage has prompted protests and demonstrations from LGBTQ+ rights advocates and their allies.[28] Some opponents of the bill have vowed to challenge its constitutionality in court.[28]

## Supporting Transgender Students

If you or someone close to you has experienced bullying or discrimination, you can start by talking about it with your school and district officials.[29] Contact your school district and find out about its nondiscrimination and anti-bullying policies.[29] Many schools are willing to work with transgender students to find a solution once they understand what’s going on.[29] 

Tips about how to talk to your school and resources can be found on NCTE’s School Action Center at www.transequality.org/schoolaction.[29] If your school district still refuses to treat you with respect, you can contact the national offices of GLSEN or your state ACLU chapter for help.[29] 

GLSEN and ACLU can help you figure out the next steps that are right for you, such as finding other ways to reach out to your school administrator or school district, bringing media attention to your issue, or taking other actions.[29] In some cases, you may consider filing a lawsuit against your school.[Failed
29] Filing a lawsuit might be complicated and you will probably need to get a lawyer to help you.[29]

NCTE does not take clients or provide legal services, but you can find a list of LGBT-friendly legal groups on their website.[29] You can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education if you want to take action against your school for discrimination.[29] Complaints need to be filed within 180 days of when the discrimination or bullying and harassment happened.[29]

# Hate Crimes Against Transgender Individuals

Hate crimes and violence targeting transgender individuals remain serious issues, even as societal attitudes slowly improve. Advocacy groups are working to track crimes, raise awareness, and achieve justice.

## FBI Hate Crime Statistics

In 2019, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released crime statistics that indicate a rise in anti-LGBTQ hate crimes.[30] The statistics reveal that hate crimes targeting the LGBTQ community increased by 20% in 2018 compared to the previous year.[30] The FBI's report shows that there were 1,445 reported incidents of hate crimes based on sexual orientation in 2018.[30] This marks the highest number of reported anti-LGBTQ hate crimes since 2001.[30]

The data also indicates that hate crimes motivated by gender identity increased by 41% in 2018.[30] The FBI's report highlights that transgender individuals were particularly vulnerable to hate crimes, with a 20% increase in reported incidents targeting them specifically.[30]

## Fatal Violence Against Transgender People

Since 2013, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) has been tracking incidents of fatal transgender violence.[31] In 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) started reporting on hate crimes motivated by anti-transgender bias.[31] The victims of transgender violence are loving partners, parents, family members, friends, and community members.[32] The victims of transgender violence worked, went to school, and attended houses of worship.[33] The victims of transgender violence were real people who did not deserve to have their lives taken from them.[34]

HRC is working towards justice and equality for transgender and gender non-conforming people.[35] HRC mourns the loss of transgender individuals in 2023.[36]

## HRC Tracking of Violence  

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released its annual crime report for 2022, showing a 13.8% increase in hate crimes based on sexual orientation and a 32.9% increase in hate crimes based on gender identity.[37]

Human Rights Campaign (HRC) is the nation's largest LGBTQ+ civil rights organization.[37] HRC President Kelley Robinson made a statement in response to the FBI's report on hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community.[37] The rise in hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community is attributed to hostile rhetoric from anti-equality figures and the passage of discriminatory bills, particularly targeting transgender individuals, in state legislatures.[37]

The FBI's data serves as an alarming indicator of the state of emergency the LGBTQ+ community finds itself in.[37] Many cities and states are reporting incomplete or no data at all on hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community.[37] In 2022, there were 1,947 recorded incidents of hate crimes based on sexual orientation, up from 1,711 the previous year.[37] In 2022, there were 469 recorded incidents of hate crimes based on gender identity, up from 353 the previous year.[37]

HRC has been tracking a wave of fatal violence against transgender people, especially Black transgender women.[37] Incomplete data reporting for hate crimes is a longstanding problem.[37] HRC called for the Department of Justice to encourage local law enforcement to report hate crimes statistics annually in a document called the "Blueprint for Positive Change".[37] The Biden-Harris administration has taken steps to improve reporting compliance, but more is necessary to ensure accurate and complete hate crimes reporting, including making reporting mandatory.[37]

There has been an unprecedented spike in anti-LGBTQ+ state legislation, with over 550 bills introduced in 43 states and over 80 signed into law, doubling the previous year's record.[37] HRC declared a national state of emergency for LGBTQ+ people in response to the spike in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, rhetoric, and violence.[37] HRC is America's largest civil rights organization working for LGBTQ+ equality.[37]

# Healthcare Policies for Transgender Individuals

Access to gender-affirming healthcare remains a contentious political issue, with new laws limiting care enacted in many states. However, federal and state policies also aim to protect transgender people's healthcare rights. Ongoing advocacy and litigation continues around this fundamental issue.

## Insurance Nondiscrimination Laws and Policies

Insurance nondiscrimination laws and policies protect LGBTQ people from being unfairly denied health insurance coverage or excluded from coverage for certain health care procedures based on sexual orientation or gender identity.[38]

Bans on transgender exclusions in health insurance are policies that bar health insurers from explicitly refusing to cover transgender-related health care benefits.[38] Transgender exclusions in health insurance service coverage are prohibited in 24 states and the District of Columbia.[38]  

Law prohibits health insurance discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in 14 states, 1 territory, and the District of Columbia.[38] Law prohibits health insurance discrimination based only on gender identity in 8 states.[38] Law prohibits health insurance discrimination based only on sexual orientation in 0 states.[38]  

There are no laws providing LGBTQ-inclusive insurance protections in 26 states and 4 territories.[38] Law explicitly permits insurers to refuse to cover gender-affirming care in 2 states.[38] In Mississippi, state law explicitly allows private insurers to refuse to cover gender-affirming care for minors, as part of its statewide ban on best practice medical care for transgender youth.[38] Arkansas law allows the refusal of coverage for gender-affirming care for everyone, regardless of age.[38]

## Bans on Medical Care for Transgender People

Prior to 2021, no states banned medical care for transgender youth.[39] 15 states have bans on at least some forms of medical care for transgender youth.[39] Nearly one in five (19%) transgender youth currently live in states where they are banned from receiving best-practice medical care.[39]

Nearly three in 10 bills (29%) introduced in 2023 would ban or restrict care for both transgender children and transgender adults.[39] Nearly half of bills introduced in 2023 would prevent state funding for medical care for at least some transgender people.[39]

Since 2020, roughly one out of seven bills (14%) would ban or restrict private insurance companies from covering or reimbursing the costs of best-practice medical care for transgender people, or would explicitly allow insurance companies to refuse coverage outright.[39]

The number of bills that make it easier for people to sue doctors who provide medical care to transgender people nearly quadrupled from 16% in 2020 to 61% in 2023.[39] The health care targeted by anti-transgender extremists is medically necessary care that is prescribed by experienced doctors who utilize best practices endorsed by all major medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.[39]

## State Laws Protecting Transgender Care

At least 12 states have passed legislation to limit or ban gender-affirming health care for young people this year.[40] Missouri announced restrictions that would apply to people of any age.[40] Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, and Minnesota have passed bills to protect transgender health care through legal protections, health care coverage, and access.[40] 

The Minnesota legislature passed protections for youth, parents, and providers seeking and giving health care.[40] California passed a similar bill last year, calling itself a "refuge" state for transgender youth and their families.[40] Oregon Democrats are proposing a constitutional amendment to protect transgender care.[40] Washington State and Vermont have their own protective bills.[40]

The Minnesota Senate passed a bill preventing compliance with child removal requests, extraditions, arrests, or subpoenas related to gender-affirming health care in Minnesota.[40] Physicians and families in Minnesota have said the bill will ensure continued access to treatment without fear of other states' laws.[40] Gender-affirming care is considered life-saving health care.[40]

Some lawmakers in Republican-controlled states aim to restrict transgender health care in the first bills of 2023.[40] State legislatures in Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia have introduced bills that would ban or restrict gender-affirming health care for transgender and gender-nonconforming people.[40]

## Legislative Attacks on LGBTQ Rights

Lawmakers in 37 U.S. states have introduced at least 142 bills to restrict gender-affirming healthcare for trans and gender-expansive people in 2023.[41] This year's number of bills is nearly three times as many as last year.[41] Four-fifths of the bills target gender-affirming care for trans children under 18.[41] The remaining bills target adults or anyone regardless of age.[41] 

Reuters has reviewed the bills, assessing their approval process, the treatments they seek to restrict, and the penalties they would impose.[41]

## Know Your Rights  

Federal and state law prohibits most public and private health plans from discriminating against transgender individuals.[42] It is illegal discrimination for health plans to refuse to cover medically necessary transition-related care, with few exceptions.[42]

Health plans cannot have automatic or categorical exclusions of transition-related care.[42] Health plans cannot have a categorical exclusion of a specific transition-related procedure.[42] Insurance companies cannot place discriminatory limits on coverage for transition-related care.[42] Insurance companies cannot refuse to enroll transgender individuals, cancel their coverage, or charge higher rates based on their transgender status.[42]

It is illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage for care typically associated with one gender based on assigned sex at birth or gender listed in insurance records.[42]

LGBTQ individuals have rights in health care, including the right to be treated with respect, get the care you need, have your gender identity and name respected, and more.[42] Discrimination complaints can be filed with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights.[42]

# International Laws Protecting Transgender Rights   

Transgender rights protections and social acceptance vary greatly across different countries and regions worldwide. While some countries are progressive, others criminalize LGBTQ identities. Ongoing advocacy continues to promote transgender rights globally.

## Europe and Central Asia

Legal protections for trans people in Europe and Central Asia have shown an upward trajectory in many policy areas over the last ten years.[43] The areas where most improvements have been made are the removal of restrictions on legal gender recognition and the implementation of trans-specific non-discrimination legislation.[43]

However, progress must come faster for the most marginalized trans communities, especially trans youth, whose rights are often the first to be restricted.[44] Better protections are also needed for trans refugees, sex workers, disabled trans people, and racialized trans people.[44]

While legal protections are increasing on paper, implementation in practice remains crucial.[44] Anti-trans backlash in some countries demonstrates the challenges still faced.[44]

## Calls to Action  

Trans people worldwide are calling on governments to take immediate action to ensure trans individuals can live free from violence and discrimination.[45] This requires strong investment in legal protections at national and regional levels, as well as implementation in practice.[45]

Civil society organizations, human rights defenders, and policymakers should stay alert and keep working together to create more inclusive societies, implement effective measures to combat violence and discrimination, and promote full respect for the human rights of trans individuals.[45]

## Country Examples

The United States has seen an unprecedented spike in anti-LGBTQ legislation recently, disproportionately targeting transgender youth.[46] States like Florida and Texas have passed highly restrictive laws banning gender-affirming medical care for minors and limiting bathroom access, school sports, and classroom discussions.[46]

Russia is considering legislation to ban all gender-affirming medical care for transgender people, which would deny them access to essential healthcare.[47] India's government has opposed LGBTQ rights like same-sex marriage, while conversion therapy remains prevalent.[48] Uganda has imposed harsh penalties for same-sex relationships and placed limits on LGBTQ speech, housing, and reproductive rights.[49]

In many parts of the world, simply existing as a transgender individual remains extremely difficult or even life-threatening. Ongoing advocacy and legal challenges provide hope for progress, but the climate for LGBTQ people in many countries remains hostile.

# Political Debates on Transgender Rights

Transgender rights have become a heated topic of political debate, legislation, and policy in America. While Democrats largely support transgender protections, Republicans have pushed bills restricting rights at the state level.

## Anti-Trans Legislation in 2023 

In 2023, a total of 583 anti-trans bills were proposed across the country.[50] Out of the 583 proposed bills, 85 have already passed.[50] Among the passed bills, 84 have been signed into law.[50] One bill has passed but has not yet been vetoed or signed.[50] The number of passed bills may change as legislative sessions continue throughout the year.[50]

In 2022, a total of 174 anti-trans bills were proposed.[50] Out of the 174 proposed bills in 2022, 26 passed.[50] The percentage of bills passed in 2022 was 15%.[50]

## Debates Among Politicians

Former Vice President Mike Pence and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy called for a federal ban on gender-affirming care for both trans kids and adults at the Republican presidential debate in Simi Valley.[51] None of the other five Republicans on stage criticized Pence and Ramaswamy's proposals.[51]

Ramaswamy referred to transgenderism, especially in kids, as a mental health disorder and advocated for parental notification.[51] Ramaswamy shared anecdotes of individuals who regretted gender-affirming surgeries. He vowed to ban genital mutilation or chemical castration if elected president.[51] 

Studies have shown that while some transgender people opt for gender-affirming medical care, many do not use medication or surgery to transition, and few choose to detransition.[51]

Pence supported Ramaswamy's proposal and emphasized the need to protect children from what he called a radical gender ideology agenda.[51] Former President Trump proposed banning facilities that provide gender-affirming care from receiving federal funding, which would likely reduce access to such care nationwide.[51]

Polls indicate that a majority of Republicans believe the nation has gone too far in accepting transgender people.[51] Less than 1% of Americans identify as transgender.[51] Since the repeal of the bathroom bill, North Carolina and 21 other states have banned gender-affirming care for kids, and some states like Oklahoma, Texas, and South Carolina have considered banning it for transgender adults. Legal battles surround many of these laws.[51]

## Laws in Specific States

On April 5th, 2023, a bill was passed in Arkansas to prohibit requiring employees of public schools and state-supported institutions of higher education to use a person's preferred pronoun, name, or title without parental consent.[52]

In Tennessee, a bill specifies that school employees are not required to refer to a student using their preferred pronoun if it is not consistent with their biological sex.[53]

On May 24th, 2023, Rhode Island proposed a bill instructing administrations to inform parents of gender identity changes in students.[54]

US SB1597 is a bill introduced to the U.S. Congress that prevents minors from receiving gender affirming care.[55]

US SB457 is a bill introduced to the U.S. Congress that establishes a federal tort against pediatric gender clinics.[56]

California has enacted laws, such as Senate Bill 107, to protect transgender citizens and prevent their children from being taken away or criminally prosecuted for supporting their trans kids.[57]

In September 2022, Colorado's governor signed a bill preventing healthcare providers from outing patients' gender identities.[58]

## Bills in Congress

Transgender military service and transgender rights in the U.S. remain politically contentious.[59] President Joe Biden signed an executive order lifting a ban on transgender service in the military that was put in place by his predecessor, Donald Trump.[59] The previous administration argued that open service by transgender troops would hurt military effectiveness and morale.[59]

The bill has 22 Democratic co-sponsors.[59] The bill faces challenges in passing while Republicans control the House.[59] Republicans introduced a bill last month that would force transgender troops to serve under their birth sex.[59] The American Medical Association maintains that gender dysphoria is not a valid reason to disqualify someone from military service.[59] 

The Republican bill would require transgender service members who have already come out to go back to serving as their sex assigned at birth.[59] Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Jim Banks are the sponsors of the Republican bill.[59] Rubio criticized the Biden administration for turning the military into a "woke social experiment" and suggested focusing more on countering threats from China, Russia, and North Korea.[59]

# Public Opinion on Transgender Rights

Public views on policies affecting transgender people are complex, with support growing but many Americans still backing some restrictive policies. Overall attitudes continue to shift, albeit gradually.

## Support for Restrictive Policies

Clear majorities of Americans support restrictions affecting transgender children.[60] A 57 percent majority of adults believe that a person's gender is determined from the start, while 43 percent believe it can differ.[60] 

The Pew Research Center found that 60 percent of Americans believe one's gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth, up from 54 percent in 2017.[60] Even among young adults, about half believe that a person's gender is determined by their sex at birth.[60]

State lawmakers introduced more than 400 anti-trans bills in 2023, up from about 150 bills in 2022.[60] Alyssa Wells, a behavior therapist in Daytona Beach, Fla., said her views on transgender issues have changed in recent years.[60] Treatments for trans youth sometimes include hormone therapies, but not genital surgery.[60]

## Mixed Views

The Post-KFF poll found that most Americans oppose access to puberty blockers and hormone treatments for children and teenagers.[60] Seventeen states ban hormone and/or other medical treatments for transgender youth.[60] More than 3 in 4 adults said it was inappropriate to discuss trans identity with students in kindergarten through third grade.[60] 

Eight states have laws limiting classroom discussion of LGBTQ issues.[60] Americans are closely split when it comes to potential laws and policies that would make it illegal for public school districts to teach about gender identity in elementary schools.[60] A Florida law that took effect in July prohibits classroom discussion on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through grade 3.[60]

While some Americans hold negative views on transgender rights, acceptance has grown over time. But major political divides remain, with debates likely to continue over policies affecting transgender youth and adults.

# School Experiences of Transgender Youth

Many transgender and gender nonconforming youth face challenges in school environments. Some schools are implementing more supportive policies, but issues like bullying and discrimination persist.

## Personal Accounts

Dandelion Hunt-Smith is a transgender and nonbinary senior at John O’Connell High School in San Francisco, Calif.[61] Dandelion moved from Georgia to California last year in search of a more welcoming school environment. Dandelion believes that school environments that treat all students as human and provide a safe and supportive space for exploring gender identity are valuable.

There is a growing number of legislation targeting LGBTQ students being introduced across the country.[62] Families like Dandelion's are calling on schools to better support future generations.

## Research Findings 

The study documents the school experiences of 295 transgender middle and high school students.[63] Transgender students face extremely high levels of victimization in schools. Transgender students experience higher levels of victimization compared to their non-transgender lesbian, gay, and bisexual peers.[64]

Transgender and gender non-conforming youth face challenges at home, at school, in foster care, and in juvenile justice systems. A national survey by GLSEN found that 75% of transgender youth feel unsafe at school. Transgender youth who are able to persevere had significantly lower GPAs. Transgender youth who are able to persevere are more likely to miss school out of concern for their safety. Transgender youth who are able to persevere are less likely to plan on continuing their education.[63]

School officials often refuse to respect the gender identity of transgender and gender non-conforming students. 59% of trans students have been denied access to restrooms consistent with their gender identity. Many students struggle for the ability to come to school and be themselves without being punished for expressing their gender identity. Some transgender and gender non-conforming students are denied opportunities to go on field trips or participate in sports. 

Conflicts related to gender identity can lead to disproportionate discipline, school pushout, and involvement in the juvenile justice system. Many states and local school districts have adopted non-discrimination and anti-bullying laws and policies that explicitly include gender identity and expression. Specific policies and training have been developed to spell out what nondiscrimination means for trans students.[65]

## Federal Policies

U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten hosted a roundtable with transgender students and their parents who are faith leaders advocating for their children and communities. Five parents and four students participated in the roundtable. 

U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona expressed support for transgender students through video remarks. Deputy Secretary Marten reaffirmed the administration's support for transgender students and their right to learn as themselves. Assistant Secretary for Office for Civil Rights Catherine Lhamon mentioned that federal law is in place to protect the rights of transgender students.[66]

Some students shared their experiences of facing bullying, misgendering, forced outing, and hateful comments from peers, teachers, and administrators. Some students testified and spoke against discriminating laws in their states. Parents expressed their desire for their children to live a life free from the trauma of hatred and discrimination. Some parents filed complaints with school officials, met with leaders, and considered moving out of the country to ensure a better experience for their children. Both the students and parents spoke about the importance of sharing their experiences in public spaces to support their peers. 

Assistant Secretary Rodriguez expressed support for the students and commended them for testifying and supporting their friends.[66]

# Social Media Influence on Transgender Rights

Social media has provided benefits but also risks for transgender individuals. Platforms have enabled community building but also spread of misinformation. Some states aim to restrict classroom discussions related to LGBTQ identities.

## Benefits and Risks

Social media platforms have provided a space for increased support, advocacy, and visibility for the LGBTQ community.[67] Social media allows LGBTQ youth to receive information, realize they are not alone, and connect with others who share similar experiences.[67]

However, social media platforms have also been used as a tool for harassment and discrimination against the LGBTQ community.[68] Gender identity moderated the association between social media practices and mental health outcomes.[68] Active social media use was associated with lower emotional problems for transgender and gender nonbinary youths compared to cisgender youths.[68] 

Taking intentional breaks from social media was associated with increased depression for transgender and gender nonbinary youths but not for cisgender youths.[68] Cleaning and curating social media feeds was associated with lower depression and conduct problems for transgender and gender nonbinary youths but higher depression and conduct problems for cisgender youths.[68] 

The findings suggest that social media may be a protective factor for some transgender and gender nonbinary youths in terms of mental health. The study found that gender identity is a key moderator of social media's effects on youths.[68]

## Spread of Misinformation

Extremist politicians and their allies engineered an anti-LGBTQ misinformation campaign following the passage of Florida's "Don't Say Gay or Trans" bill.[69] The campaign saw discriminatory and inflammatory "grooming" content surge by over 400% on social media platforms.[69] 

A small group of extremist politicians and their allies were responsible for driving the anti-LGBTQ content.[69] Twitter failed to enforce its own policies banning anti-LGBTQ slurs, taking no action on 99% of the 100 hateful tweets reported to them.[69] On Facebook and Instagram, 59 paid ads promoted the same anti-LGBTQ narrative, with only one ad being removed.[69]

## Florida's Stance

The rise of online anti-LGBTQ hate has political implications and real-world consequences, including increased hate crimes and violence against LGBTQ individuals.[69] In Florida, access to gender-affirming care has been banned for all children under 18.[70] In Florida, teachers can no longer discuss gender and sexuality in the classroom.[70]

# Trans Activists and Influencers

Transgender activists and influencers have used their platforms to raise awareness, advocate for rights, and spread information. However, some have also faced backlash for their stances.

## Views from Different Perspectives

Oli London believes TikTok and its transgender stars are responsible for the rise in gender ideology and confusion among adolescents.[71] London spent eight hours a day on TikTok and became addicted to it.[71] London started questioning his own gender identity after seeing videos about people's new personas and pronouns on TikTok.[71]

London believes the trend of gender transitions promoted on TikTok destroys lives, families, and the lives of children.[71] London criticizes the rewarding of influencers like Dylan Mulvaney for their transition journeys, which he sees as offensive to women who have been females their whole lives.[71]

Trans activist Eli Erlick coordinated efforts to send prescription drugs, including hormones and puberty blockers, to states where it is illegal to prescribe gender transition treatments for minors.[71] Erlick believes transgender people, including youth, need access to gender-affirming healthcare and that bans on these medications should be lifted.[71] 

Erlick disagrees with London's understanding of the trans community and healthcare, accusing him of spreading anti-trans propaganda.[71] London criticizes the praise given to a nonbinary activist who tells children to cut off contact with their parents if they don't affirm their gender identity.[71]

London believes TikTok is causing irreparable harm to young people who are undergoing hormone treatments and irreversible surgeries due to the influence of harmful trends.[71]

# Transgender Athletes Rights   

Whether transgender athletes should be allowed to compete on sports teams aligning with their gender identity has become a heated political issue. Republicans have pushed bans, while Democrats argue they are discriminatory.

## Legislation in Congress

House Republicans voted to prohibit transgender student athletes from competing on girls sports teams consistent with their gender identity.[72] The bill, H.R. 734, passed on a party-line vote of 219-203.[73] The bill would apply to K-12 schools as well as colleges that receive federal funding.[73]

The bill singles out transgender female athletes by making it a violation of Title IX for schools to allow "a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls".[73] The bill would amend Title IX so that "sex shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth".[73]

The sponsor of the bill is Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla.[73] Several lawmakers did not vote on the bill, including 10 Democrats and 3 Republicans.[73] An amendment from Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) was passed by voice vote, clarifying that the term "athletic programs and activities" in the bill includes any activities where you have to participate on a team.[73]

## State Bans on Participation 

Anti-LGBTQ activists and politicians have introduced and passed laws to ban transgender youth from participating in school sports.[74] These laws mean that transgender girls would not be allowed to participate in sports with other girls.[74] 

Local schools and state athletic associations already have policies that protect transgender people and ensure a level playing field for all athletes.[74] The policies shown prohibit transgender people's participation in sports, which are unnecessary and harmful.[74]

23 states have laws that ban transgender students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity.[74] 1 state has regulations that ban transgender students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity.[74] 26 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia do not have laws that ban transgender students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity.[74]

## Proposed Federal Rules

The U.S. Department of Education will not finalize changes to Title IX until October.[75] The changes aim to enshrine in federal regulations that Title IX protections against sex discrimination apply to discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.[75]

The Education Department originally planned to release the finalized rules in May but extended the date to October due to a record number of public comments.[75] The first proposal, released in July 2022, would change Title IX's definition of sex-based discrimination and harassment to cover discrimination based on gender identity and sexuality. It received around 240,000 public comments.[75]

The second rule, released in April, would prohibit categorical bans on transgender athletes' membership on athletic teams that align with their gender identity. It generated 150,000 comments.[75] Since 2020, 21 states have passed laws that bar transgender athletes from playing sports on teams that align with their gender identity.[75]

## Debate Over Policies

The proposed Title IX changes will require administrative work for school leaders to establish new regulations for sports eligibility.[75] School administrators will have to adjust in the middle of the school year, which is challenging.[75] The proposed changes would likely require additional staff training, communication with parents and community members, and updates to school policies and handbooks.[75]

The situation may be especially tricky for school districts in states that ban transgender athletes from playing on teams that align with their gender identity.[75] Finalized rules could lead to lawsuits challenging state laws and the new federal regulation.[75] The Education Department should allow schools ample time to adjust to the change when the finalized rules are released.[75]

# Transgender Bathroom Rights

Laws regulating access to bathrooms and facilities based on gender identity remain contested, with states passing conflicting policies. Courts have blocked some laws, while other bans remain in effect.

## Anti-Trans Legislation

In 2023, a total of 583 anti-trans bills were proposed across the country.[76] Out of the 583 proposed bills, 85 have already passed.[76] Among the 85 passed bills, 84 have been signed into law.[76] One bill has passed but has not yet been vetoed or signed.[76] The number of passed bills may change as legislative sessions continue throughout the year.[76]

In 2022, a total of 174 anti-trans bills were proposed.[76] Out of the 174 proposed bills in 2022, 26 passed.[76] The percentage of bills passed in 2022 was 15%.[76]

## Legal Challenges

A group of trans and non-binary people asked a federal court to declare Florida's bathroom ban unconstitutional and to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prohibit authorities from enforcing it against them while they are in Florida in the coming weeks.[77]

The temporary restraining order (TRO) would allow the plaintiffs to use public bathrooms that align with their gender as they travel to, participate in, and return from the National March to Protect Trans Youth in Orlando on October 7.[77]

Plaintiff Christynne Lili Wrene Wood was targeted by an organized campaign challenging her legal rights to use the women's locker room at the Cameron YMCA in Santee, California.[77] Governor Ron DeSantis signed four anti-trans bills in May, including the bathroom ban, which plaintiffs say violates their rights to free expression, equal protection, and non-discrimination.[77]

## Restrictive Policies

The ban forces trans, gender-nonconforming, and certain intersex people to use a bathroom inconsistent with their identities, risk arrest by using a bathroom consistent with their identities, or forego multi-stall restrooms in public facilities altogether.[77] Florida's bathroom ban applies to all public and government facilities, not just public schools.[77] 

In 2023, 568 anti-trans bills were introduced in 49 states.[77] The Center for Constitutional Rights and Southern Legal Counsel filed a complaint and motion for the temporary restraining order (TRO) on behalf of the plaintiffs against Florida's bathroom ban.[77]

State bans transgender people from using bathrooms and facilities consistent with their gender identity in all schools, colleges, and government-owned buildings and spaces.[78] State bans transgender people from using bathrooms and facilities consistent with their gender identity in K-12 schools and at least some government-owned buildings.[78] 

State bans transgender people from using bathrooms and facilities consistent with their gender identity in K-12 schools.[78] No state ban on transgender people’s use of bathrooms or facilities.[78] State law makes it a criminal offense for transgender people to use bathrooms or facilities consistent with their gender identity.[78]

# Transgender Military Service Rights

Policies around transgender military service members have shifted between administrations. Advocates continue working to protect open service, while some lawmakers aim to reinstate restrictions.

## DOD Policy Under Biden 

The new DOD policy does not ban transgender individuals from military service. Transgender individuals are not excluded from military service, and DOD policy prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. However, all individuals, whether transgender or not, must meet military standards associated with their biological sex. Waivers or exceptions to these standards may be granted on a case-by-case basis.[79]

Transgender service members who joined the military in their preferred gender or were diagnosed with gender dysphoria before the 2018 policy took effect are exempt from the new policy and may serve in their preferred gender. The policy does not ask currently serving transgender service members to leave the military, and it prohibits involuntary separation based solely on gender identity. The privacy of transgender service members is also protected.[80]

The new policy was developed after consultation with military and medical experts and is focused on enhancing readiness. It aims to maintain high standards necessary for maximum readiness, deployability, and combat effectiveness. Individuals with a history of gender dysphoria who have undergone certain medical treatments or are unable to meet the standards associated with their biological sex are presumptively disqualified for service without a waiver.[81]

## Legislation in Congress

A Democratic bill opposing a Republican proposal that would force transgender troops to serve under their birth sex has been introduced in Congress.[82] The new bill, sponsored by Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., would allow anyone who meets occupational standards to serve in the military regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.[82]

Transgender military service and transgender rights in the U.S. remain politically contentious.[82] President Joe Biden signed an executive order lifting a ban on transgender service in the military that was put in place by his predecessor, Donald Trump.[82] The previous administration argued that open service by transgender troops would hurt military effectiveness and morale.[82]

The bill has 22 Democratic co-sponsors.[82] The bill faces challenges in passing while Republicans control the House.[82] Republicans introduced a bill last month that would force transgender troops to serve under their birth sex.[82] The American Medical Association maintains that gender dysphoria is not a valid reason to disqualify someone from military service.[82]

## Ban Under Previous Administration

The Republican bill would require transgender service members who have already come out to go back to serving as their sex assigned at birth.[82] Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Jim Banks are the sponsors of the Republican bill.[82] Rubio criticized the Biden administration for turning the military into a "woke social experiment" and suggested focusing more on countering threats from China, Russia, and North Korea.[82]

President Biden reversed Trump's ban on transgender service when he took office in 2021.[82] There is no clear evidence that allowing transgender troops to serve openly is a detriment to the military.[82] Advocates for open service fear that a future president could reinstate a ban on transgender service if protections are not enshrined in law.[82]

# Transgender Representation in Media

Transgender and LGBTQ representation in television and media has gradually increased but remains below proportional representation in society. Ongoing advocacy pushes for more inclusion.

## GLAAD Report Findings

GLAAD counted 659 series regulars set to appear on scripted primetime broadcast series for the 2022-2023 season. Of those, 70 (10.6 percent) are LGBTQ. This is a decrease of 22 characters and 1.3 percent from last year.[83] There are an additional 31 LGBTQ recurring characters counted, bringing the total to 101 LGBTQ characters on broadcast, an overall decrease of 40 characters from the previous year.[83]

On primetime scripted cable, GLAAD counted 86 regular LGBTQ characters and 53 LGBTQ recurring characters, bringing the total to 139 LGBTQ characters. That is an increase of one character from the previous year’s total.[83]

On the streaming services Apple TV+, Amazon Prime, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+ and Peacock, GLAAD counted 239 series regular LGBTQ characters and 117 LGBTQ recurring characters, bringing the total to 356 LGBTQ characters. That is a decrease of two characters from the previous year’s report.[83]

Of the 596 LGBTQ characters found across all platforms, there were 32 transgender characters counted in this report (5.4 percent of all LGBTQ characters).[83] Of those, there were 16 trans women, 11 trans men, and five trans nonbinary characters.[83]

Over half of all LGBTQ characters across platforms were people of color (POC), with 304 out of 596 (51 percent of all LGBTQ characters) being POC.[83] There were 27 LGBTQ characters (4.5 percent of all LGBTQ characters) in this report counted with a disability.[83]

Of the 596 LGBTQ characters, 175 (29 percent) will not be returning due to series cancellations, endings, miniseries/anthology format, or a character dying or leaving the show.[83]

# Transgender Rights Legislation

Legislation impacting transgender individuals has rapidly increased, with record numbers of anti-trans bills proposed across the U.S. Internationally, some countries are expanding rights, while others impose harsh restrictions.

## Anti-Trans Bills in U.S.

In 2023, a total of 583 anti-trans bills were proposed across the country.[84] Out of the 583 proposed bills, 85 have already passed.[84] Among the passed bills, 84 have been signed into law.[84] One bill has passed but has not yet been vetoed or signed.[84] The number of passed bills may change as legislative sessions continue throughout the year.[84]

In 2022, a total of 174 anti-trans bills were proposed.[84] Out of the 174 proposed bills in 2022, 26 passed.[84] The percentage of bills passed in 2022 was 15%.[84]

## International Actions

A federal district judge in Arkansas has permanently blocked the state's ban on gender-affirming health care for transgender children.[85] The ban was enacted in 2021 and was the first in the United States to prohibit gender-affirming care for transgender children.[85] 

The legislation prohibited interventions to delay the onset of puberty, hormone treatment, and gender-affirming surgery for transgender children.[85] Governor Asa Hutchinson initially vetoed the legislation, but lawmakers successfully overrode his veto to make it law.[85]

As of 2023, twenty US states have banned at least some medical care for transgender children, rejecting medically accepted best practices.[85] Access to gender-affirming care can lessen depression, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts for recipients of that care.[85]

## Restrictions in U.S. States

Major medical organizations have overwhelmingly opposed efforts to ban gender-affirming care.[85] Anti-transgender legislation in the United States includes bills that aim to prohibit transgender children from playing sports, using bathrooms consistent with their gender identity, and learning about sexual orientation and gender identity in schools.[85]

The barrage of anti-transgender legislation has taken a toll on the mental health of transgender youth, leading some families to move to other states for their children's safety.[85] The court concluded that the ban in Arkansas was unconstitutional because it discriminated against transgender children, violated their parents' rights to obtain medical care for their children, and violated the free expression of medical professionals who provide gender-affirming care.[85]

Federal judges in Florida and Indiana have temporarily blocked bans on gender-affirming healthcare, and a similar law in Alabama has been blocked as well.[85] Trans people ask governments to take immediate action.[86] Trans individuals have the right to live free from violence and discrimination.[86]

# Transgender Rights Movements

Transgender rights movements have made progress through advocacy and legal challenges worldwide. However, many countries still criminalize LGBTQ identities, imposing harsh penalties.

## Actions Worldwide

In 2023, President Yoweri Museveni signed an "Anti-Homosexuality" bill into law in Uganda.[87] The bill punishes homosexuality with imprisonment up to life.[87] The bill allows "aggravated homosexuality" to be punished by death.[87] The definition of "aggravated homosexuality" includes rape, sex with children, the elderly, and people with disabilities.[87]

Homosexual activities performed by second-time offenders or those with HIV are considered aggravated and punishable by death.[87] The only homosexual activity that is not punishable by death would take place between consenting adults (under the age of 75) who do not have HIV or previous convictions of homosexuality.[87] "Attempted Homosexuality" is punished by law, with a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.[87] "Attempted Aggravated Homosexuality" can be met with a penalty of up to 14 years in prison.[87]

## Workplace Discrimination

On April 5th, 2023, a bill was passed in Arkansas to prohibit requiring employees of public schools and state-supported institutions of higher education to use a person's preferred pronoun, name, or title without parental consent.[88]

In Tennessee, a bill specifies that school employees are not required to refer to a student using their preferred pronoun if it is not consistent with their biological sex.[89]

On May 24th, 2023, Rhode Island proposed a bill instructing administrations to inform parents of gender identity changes in students.[90]

US SB1597 is a bill introduced to the U.S. Congress that prevents minors from receiving gender affirming care.[91]

US SB457 is a bill introduced to the U.S. Congress that establishes a federal tort against pediatric gender clinics.[92]

California has enacted laws, such as Senate Bill 107, to protect transgender citizens and prevent their children from being taken away or criminally prosecuted for supporting their trans kids.[93]

In September 2022, Colorado's governor signed a bill preventing healthcare providers from outing patients' gender identities.[94]

# Workplace Discrimination Against Transgender Individuals

Many transgender workers face mistreatment, bias, and barriers in the workplace. However, legal protections are expanding, and best practices for employers can create more inclusive environments.

## Prevalence of Discrimination

More than one in four transgender people have lost a job due to bias. More than three-fourths of transgender people have experienced some form of workplace discrimination. Refusal to hire, privacy violations, harassment, and even physical and sexual violence on the job are common occurrences for transgender individuals. 

Transgender people of color experience workplace discrimination at even higher rates. Many transgender individuals change jobs to avoid discrimination or the risk of discrimination. Extreme levels of unemployment and poverty lead one in eight transgender individuals to become involved in underground economies, such as sex and drug work, in order to survive.[95]

## Legal Protections  

The Supreme Court case Bostock v. Clayton County, decided on June 15, 2020, clarified that federal law prohibits anti-transgender discrimination in employment. Courts and federal agencies have increasingly taken the view that job discrimination against transgender people is prohibited by existing laws against sex discrimination.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) accepted an inclusive understanding of sex discrimination laws in 2012. The EEOC has investigated and settled many cases on behalf of transgender workers and has identified LGBTQ workers' rights as an enforcement priority.

## Best Practices for Employers

Responsive HR policies can help create an inclusive work environment and minimize liability for discrimination. HR infrastructure should provide avenues for employees to update personnel records, facilitate new identification or staff directory photos, and have plans for communication and education among coworkers.[96]

Employers should encourage open dialogue about preferred names and pronouns and embrace policies that allow employees to include pronouns in email signatures or on company-issued nametags. Training on pronoun vocabulary and guidance should be provided to all employees.[97]

# Conclusion

The rights, experiences, and acceptance of transgender individuals are complex issues that have rapidly risen to the forefront of public debate and policymaking. While transgender rights movements have made progress, backlash and polarization continue over fundamental issues like nondiscrimination protections, healthcare access, bathroom use, sports participation, and more. 

Ongoing education, advocacy, legal challenges, corporate policies, political representation, and other efforts provide hope for a more just and inclusive society for transgender people in America and worldwide. But substantial work remains to transform attitudes, beliefs, laws, and systems that still engender stigma, discrimination, and harm.
